## Project Description
What variables have the greatest impact on credit scores and how do these scores affect loans? Understanding the key variables that affect credit scores is crucial for citizens, financial corporations, and lawmakers. When it comes to adult life in most nations credit scores are hugely important as they usually determine your rates and the amount of money you can be lent. Good credit can lead to better financial opportunities and lower rates, while a lower credit score can limit opportunities and increase the cost of borrowing. Anywhere from renting an apartment, to buying a car, to purchasing a house, or getting a loan credit score plays a huge role in the process of securing funds. For people within the loaning industry knowledge of key indicators for credit score is of utmost importance. The more that they know about key indicators the more they can reflect on their practices to loan the correct amount to the right people. In the credit score world variables are constantly being added and changed. As financial technologies and lending practices evolve, new variables may emerge as key indicators in determining credit score. Alternative data sources, innovations, and changes in consumer behavior can all reshape the credit scoring formulas. To stay relevant and responsive, it is essential for citizens and corporations to stay informed about the ever-changing world of credit scores and adapt their strategies accordingly. 
### questions of interest
-What factors can we see to have a direct relationship to the outcome of credit score?
-How do these factors affect people and how should one act to raise credit score?
## Data Description
For this project, I decided to look at credit scores and how different variables affect the outcome. I specifically wanted to find the factors that affect these scores the most as it will potentially help me and other consumers in the future. Knowing information like this will help me be smarter about my credit score and practice habits which improve my score. To craft my conclusions, I needed consumer credit score data from some areas of the world. When searching for datasets it became quite clear that they were mostly complete but almost every dataset omitted the credit score received by individuals. To combat this, I was able to find a credit dataset that gives responses for either good, standard, or poor credit. With a response column, I will be able to use this dataset to craft visualizations and create a predictive model that I can feed variables to generate a potential response. My data has 27 different variables which correspond to the response column being either good, standard, or poor credit. The data also shows credit scores for individuals over 8 months and can show trends in credit scores related to certain behaviors. There are many variables that have a negligible effect on the outcome and thus columns like social security number, occupation, name, and payment behavior will be omitted. Instead, I will focus on columns where a direct relationship can be drawn like age, monthly in-hand salary, interest rate, and average outstanding debt. From these visualizations, I will be able to draw conclusions as to which variables affect credit scores. Then I will be able to further determine what factor has the most impact on the outcome.  
## Interpreting Visualizations
![newplot (5)](https://github.com/elin202/-mgt4250test/assets/152214492/e19e1ddc-deee-43fa-bdca-bd2f94d90564)
### In the first visualization the relationship between monthly in-hand salary and credit score has been plotted in a boxplot. This shows us the upper and lower bounds of each credit score description based on the monthly in-hand salary. It also includes the median values for each response and looking at this we can see that the median changes only slightly which indicates that the data is similar. This graph allows us to see that there Is a relationship between these two variables and reflects that the more in-hand salary a person has per month the more likely they are to have a higher credit score. This allows us to conclude that the more money a person makes, the more likely they are to have good credit. Although this is only a correlation and not a direct relationship, it shows us that this variable is significant.

### In the second visualization the relationship between age and credit score has been plotted in a boxplot. It shows us the upper and lower bounds for age based on the response for credit score. From this graph, we can see quite definitively that higher age directly correlates to a higher credit score. This relationship makes sense as the older the target is the more likely they have a longer credit history to improve their score. We can also see that the median ages are in the middle of their respective plots meaning that ages are not skewed higher or lower. This shows us that as age increases the likelihood of better credit also increases.

### In the third visualization the relationship between average outstanding debt and credit score is plotted in a line chart. The graph presents three different lines that represent the credit score response based on the average outstanding debt. There are clear differences between the different credit scores. A response for a good credit score can be seen to have an average debt from around $600-$800 while a standard credit score averages around $1,200-$1,500. Poor credit score can be seen to have a much higher average debt of around $2000-$2200. From this graph, we see a correlation between lower average debt and credit scores showing the variable's significance.
